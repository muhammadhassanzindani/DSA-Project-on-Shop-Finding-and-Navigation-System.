# DSA-Project-on-Shop-Finding-and-Navigation-System.
This Shop Finding and Navigation System is designed to help users find the shortest path to a shop in a city grid. The project employs data structures and algorithms, particularly graph theory, to efficiently manage and navigate through shops. The primary algorithm used for pathfinding is Dijkstra's algorithm.
